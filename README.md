# vegandocs

**vegandocs** is a standard **R** package that provides additional 
documentation for the **vegan** package of community ecological
analysis. The package contains only **R** vignette source (`.Rnw`
file) that will be processed into a **pdf** file using `Sweave`
when the **vegandocs** package is built.

Currently the only vignette is vegan tutorial. The **vegan**
package includes a vignette on ordination methods, and the
tutorial provides a more advanced introduction.
